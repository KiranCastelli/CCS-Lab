                <h3 class="green">Habitat:</h3>
                <p>Higher dimensions. In our dimension, possibly utilizes quantum entanglement to travel between
                    dimensions. When interacting with, seems to trigger a “collapse,” causing the creature to start
                    moving through dimensions.</p>

                <h3 class="green">Appearance:</h3>
                <p>Two spheres that have the exact same movement across an axis. It is widely thought that this is not
                    its true appearance, and simply a visualization of what we can see in our limited view. If viewed in
                    a higher dimension, we could possibly see its true form.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Appears to be quantum entangled with itself (why?)</li>
                    <li>No apparent bodily needs (possibly due to not being carbon based?)</li>
                    <li>Can only be observed at the most fundamental level of our reality.</li>

                This is a creature which does not fit any time of existence (theorized or other). It is a non-carbon
                based creature, that as of observations so far, has no need to breathe, eat, or perform other bodily
                functions. It appears to be able to manipulate its body at will (NOTE: Individuals who have studied this
                creature have reported seeing a different form in a higher dimension. These claims are unverified). The
                two parts of the creature's body are quantumly entangled with each other, leading to reflective
                movement.

                <span class="yellow">Guidelines for human interaction with this creature</span> This creature must be
                studied with extreme caution. It is advised to not interact with it, as this triggers a chain reaction,
                dragging the observer with the creature through dimensions. The creature is seemingly able to travel
                through time. Interacting with it while it is in a higher dimension will result in either the
                interaction being “memorized” (turned into a moment in time, and simply avoided by the creature) or the
                interaction showing no sign of affecting the creature in any way.
